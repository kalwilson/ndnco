## About

**NDNCo** was originally built as a capstone project, for the BrainStation Software Engineering bootcamp, with a simple mission: to make space for Indigenous-led businesses and communities to connect online.

While many Indigenous directories exist, they're often aimed at non-Indigenous shoppers. NDNCo takes a different approach. It's designed for Indigenous people, as a space to:

- Celebrate Indigenous business
- Support collaboration between entrepereneurs
- Uplift community through culturally conscious tech

This project marked a turning point in my growth as a developer, and it continues to inspire how I think about tech and community.

## Project Status

NDNCo was built as a functional MVP with core features complete, and backend infrastructure in place. While development paused after the capstone, this project remains a meaningful part of my developer journey.

It represents:

- My early experience with full-stack development
- My values around community, representation, and tech-for-good
- A foundation I may return to in the future
- It was also inspiration for my IndigiTech Capstone: [Lightling Labs](https://github.com/kalwilson/lightling-labs)

## Reflection

I was nervous to share this, but I've realized how much this project represents my roots as a developer. It shows initiative, cultural respect, and real-world planning, even if the execution wasn't perfect.

**Growth happens in public.**
And this was a big first step.
