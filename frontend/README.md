### Problem Space:

While there are other Indigenous business directories, none of them have been specifically created to beneift Indigenous peoples. _Most_ are created strictly to advertise, to target non-Indigenous shoppers. We plan on doing things differently. **We plan on building a space for Indigenous entrepreneurs to connect, network, uplift each other, and build an incredible community online.** The directory is just the first step.

### User Profile:

Our main user focus is Indigenous entrepreneurs, and Indigenous shoppers.

### Features:

Main focus, is setting up the directory. A list of Indigenous businesses that can be filtered through categories and subcategories. Potentially setting up a search function would be nice too.

### Tech Stack:

Vue.js, Pinia, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sass.

### API:

_To see the backend, and endpoints_ [Click here!](https://github.com/kalwilson/kal-wilson-capstone-api.git)

I will be creating my own backend and database with PostgreSQL. _In the future,_ I will be using Leaflet API, with OSM map tiles to integrate a mapping feature.

### Sitemap:

**Home:** Hero statement, example of what a business can look like on the site.
**Directory:** A list of all the (mock) businesses currently on the site.
**Register:** Form that sends business data to be verified.
**About:** How the idea came to be, but mostly how it can benefit users.
**Legal:** Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Accessibility Policy... I think I'm forgetting one. Each will have their own view, and be included in the footer.
